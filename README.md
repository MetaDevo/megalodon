# Megalodon

A minimalist ODB++ PCB viewer using Qt.

At the moment not all features are loaded.

ODB++ schematics are in a folder structure, so if you have a zipped single file you'll have to unzip it first. The Open button in this application only allows choosing folders, not single files.

## Build
The quickest way is to open the CMakeLists.txt file in QtCreator. Choose Release build type. You can build and run from there.

## Dependencies

- Qt6
